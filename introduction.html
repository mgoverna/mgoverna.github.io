		<li>
			<strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am from Charlotte but I was raised in a Northern Family. I have lived in North Carolina for a vast majority of my life, though I lived in Queens during my early childhood.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have worked four years in retail and I am currently employed at Lowe’s. I am working a leadership position looking to potentially move up to something more than what I am currently doing. Outside of my retail experience, I have five years of experience in social media management. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from Central Piedmont with an associates degree. My official degree is “Associate in Arts” and I transferred to UNC Charlotte to work towards my Bachelor’s degree in Marketing. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  Windows 11!

			<strong>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>ACCT 2122 - Principles of ACCT II:</strong> I am in this course because I am interested in accounting. This was actually going to be my major before I started leaning towards marketing, although since I have not declared a major I could always change what I want to end up going into. This course is also a prerequisite.
					</li>	
				
					<li>
						<strong>BUSN 2100 - Business Professional Development:</strong> Despite this class only being one credit, I felt that it was necessary to take this course because any route I choose to go in is business related. On top of that, this course was recommended to me by my academic advisor with me being a transfer student. 
					</li>
				
					<li>
						<strong>ITSC 1110 - Introduction to Computer Science:</strong> In all honesty, I took this course when I saw the professor's name. I had both him and his wife over at CPCC and I enjoyed both of their classes greatly. I do enjoy the concept of Computer Science and hope to learn a decent bit from this course.
					</li>
				
					<li>
						<strong>MATH 1120 - Calculus:</strong>  I am taking this course because it is a prerequisite. I am looking to simply fly by this class and end with a good grade.
					</li>
				
					<li>
						<strong>POLS 3030 - Topics in Comp or Intl Politics: Digital Twin Technology and AI Policy:</strong> This course honestly is not something I am fully interested in, but I registered pretty late for classes and this was the best option of what was left. On top of that, it is fully online so that is less commuting for me!
					</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Funny / Interesting Item about Myself:</strong> Back in the COVID days, I grew a brand to half a million supporters in 9 months. 
			</li> 
			<li>
				<strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I am obsessed with cars. Snap is @trahpex.
